## Configuration

To work with Redis in the `vemonitor_m8` package, you need to configure certain settings within the Inputs/Outputs block items.

### appConnector

To connect an interfacer or worker to a redis server you need define redis server settings on appConnectors configuration.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of the required configuration:
```yaml
appConnectors:
    # Redis appConnectors settings
    # Used to establish connections to Redis servers
    redis:
        # Source name of Redis Server
        # Defined by the user
        # str: Alphanumeric characters, '-' and/or '_'
        local:
            # Server host IP address
            # str: required
            host: "127.0.0.1"
            # Server port number
            # int: required
            port: 6379
        # Source name of Redis Server
        # Defined by the user
        # str: Alphanumeric characters, '-' and/or '_'
        remote:
            # Server host IP address
            # str: required
            host: "192.168.0.52"
            # Server port number
            # int: required
            port: 16379
            # Server password
            # str: Optional
            password: "REDIS_SERVER_PASSWORD"
```
### Input Worker

> **Warning**
> At this time Redis Input worker is not available.
> And do nothing 

To read data from Redis, you can set up a Redis input block item in the main configuration file as follows:

```yaml
    -   # Block item name (must be unique)
        name: "VedirectToRedis"
        # (...)
        inputs:
            # Redis input worker reads data from the Redis server
            redis:
              - # Input item name (must be unique)
                name: "external_data"
                # Redis server source configuration name
                # See appConnectors Redis item with the source set as "local"
                source: "local"
                # Redis storage structure
                # Here, the Redis HmapTimeSeries module is selected
                redis_data_structure: "HmapTimeSeries"
                # Read time interval
                time_interval: 1
                # Redis node (must be unique)
                # Used as the Set key to store nodes from columns
                redis_node: "bat_bmv700"
                # Reference columns for standardizing block names
                # To be processed by vemonitor_m8 middlewares
                ref_cols:  [
                    ['bat_voltage', 'V'],
                    ['bat_current', 'I'],
                    ['bat_power', 'P']
                ]
                # Node columns to read from the Redis server
                columns: 
                    # Key: hMap node name
                    # Values: column block names to extract from the data read
                    bmv700: [
                        'V', 'I', 'P', 'SOC', 'Alarm',
                        'AR', 'Relay'
                    ]
```

### Output Worker

To store data in Redis, you can set up a Redis output block item in the main configuration file as follows:

```yaml
    -   # Block item name (must be unique)
        name: "VedirectToRedis"
        # (...)
        inputs:
            "(...)"
        outputs:
            # Redis output worker writes data to the Redis server
            redis:
              - # Redis server source configuration name
                # See appConnectors Redis item with the source set as "local"
                source: "local"
                # Redis storage structure
                # Here, the Redis HmapTimeSeries module is selected
                redis_data_structure: "HmapTimeSeries"
                # Data write interval
                time_interval: 1
                # Data cache interval
                # This value, combined with time_interval,
                # determines how many points are sent simultaneously to the server.
                # Total points = time_interval * cache_interval
                # Example: Total points = 1 * 5 = 5
                # Meaning every 5 seconds, 5 points are sent per node determined by the columns key
                cache_interval: 5
                # Redis node (must be unique)
                # Used as the Set key to store nodes from columns
                redis_node: "bat_bmv700"
                # Reference columns for standardizing block names
                # To be processed by vemonitor_m8 middlewares
                ref_cols:  [
                    ['bat_voltage', 'V'],
                    ['bat_current', 'I'],
                    ['bat_power', 'P']
                ]
                # Node columns to store in the Redis server
                columns: 
                    # Key: hMap node name
                    # Values: column block names to extract from the data read
                    bmv700: [
                        'V', 'I', 'P', 'SOC', 'Alarm',
                        'AR', 'Relay'
                    ]
```
## Data store types

These modules are designed to store data on a Redis server using various types of data structures.

### Hmap Time Series
This module stores time series data as hash maps (hMaps) and is the default storage type used by the `vemonitor_m8` package. In the Inputs/Outputs workers, you can specify `redis_data_structure`: `"HmapTimeSeries"` to select this storage structure or leave the setting blank to use the default.

On the Redis server, two kinds of data are stored.

#### Nodes store
For every input/output block item, nodes are stored in a set using the  `redis_node` value as the set's key name. 

Node storage example:
> See the Redis input/output block item configuration examples below:
```python
    "bat_bmv700": ["bmv700"]
```

#### Time series store
For each column node, data time series are stored in a hash map (hMap). The hMap's name is a combination of the `columns` node name, prefixed by the `redis_node` value. Each key in the hMap represents a timestamp, and the corresponding value is a JSON-formatted dictionary containing the `columns` item values.

hMap Time Series storage example:
```python
    # Column node name prefixed by the redis_node value
    "bat_bmv700_bmv700": {
        '1725292361': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.52, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292362': '{"V": 12.065, "I": -7.537, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292363': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.537, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292364': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.514, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292365': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.536, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}'
    }
```

#### Example
For instance, if we configure the output block as follows:
```yaml
    outputs:
        # Redis output worker writes data to the Redis server
        redis:
            - # Redis server source configuration name
            # See appConnectors Redis item with the source set as "local"
            source: "local"
            # Redis storage structure
            # Here, the Redis HmapTimeSeries module is selected
            redis_data_structure: "HmapTimeSeries"
            # Data write interval
            time_interval: 1
            # Data cache interval
            # This value, combined with time_interval,
            # determines how many points are sent simultaneously to the server.
            # Total points = time_interval * cache_interval
            # Example: Total points = 1 * 5 = 5
            # Meaning every 5 seconds, 5 points are sent per node determined by the columns key
            cache_interval: 5
            # Redis node (must be unique)
            # Used as the Set key to store nodes from columns
            redis_node: "bat_bmv700"
            # Node columns to store in the Redis server
            columns: 
                # Key: hMap node name
                # Values: column block names to extract from the data read
                bmv700: [
                    'V', 'I', 'P', 'SOC', 'Alarm',
                    'AR', 'Relay'
                ]
```

In this example nodes are stored as: 
- The `redis_node` value is `bat_bmv700`
- The `columns` key contain only one node `bmv700`

This produces the following node store:
```python
    "bat_bmv700": ["bmv700"]
```

The hMap Time Series store would be as follows:
- The `redis_node` value is `bat_bmv700`
- The `columns` key contain only one node `bmv700`
- Data is sent every five seconds.
  Example: `time_interval` x `cache_interval` = `send_interval`
  => 1  x  5 = 5
  This means five time series points containing one node of columns items are sent every five seconds.

That produces an hMap like this:
```python
    # Column node name prefixed by the redis_node value
    "bat_bmv700_bmv700": {
        '1725292361': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.52, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292362': '{"V": 12.065, "I": -7.537, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292363': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.537, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292364': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.514, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}',
        '1725292365': '{"V": 12.064, "I": -7.536, "P": -91.0, "SOC": 83.8, "Alarm": 0, "AR": 0, "Relay": 0}'
    }
```
